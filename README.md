# Calculator-Web-App
This is a simple calculator web app I made that allows the user to multiply, divide, add, and subtract with either whole or decimal numbers. This calculator is also equipped to do basic expressions using the order of operations such as (5 * 8) + 6 / (48 / 3) * 12 for instance. It is not anything too fancy and mostly was made as an exercise for using css grids and to better understand the math operators and the most efficient way of evaluating expressions using javascript. I also made it to practice utilizing event listeners and updating displays based on said event listeners. Overall it took me around an hour to make and i'd say I learned quite a bit about some css/javascript techniques that are very important to perfect when trying to build websites/web applications. I do eventually plan on adding more to this calculator in the future once I have gotten better with Javascript. The calculator should be easily usable on both mobile and desktop because I also used this opportunity to try to practice making a responsive layout by using units of measurement for my elements that would size up/down with the content and screen. I also used flexbox and a grid inside of flexbox to try to achieve this.
